•	DOJ establishes cybercrime enforcement unit as U.S. warnings mount over Chinese hacking
o	https://cyberscoop.com/doj-establishes-cybercrime-enforcement-unit-natseccyber/
this is a non techincal article that covers the Department of Justice which has established a new cyber-focused section called the National Security Cyber Section (NatSec Cyber) within its National Security Division. This move aims to combat various digital crimes and elevate cyber threats to the same level as other major national security issues such as counterterrorism and counterintelligence. The establishment of this section enables the DOJ to increase the scale and speed of disruption campaigns and prosecutions related to nation-state cyber threats, state-sponsored cybercriminals, money launderers, and other cyber-enabled threats to national security.

(U) Threat Groups:
•	APT28 group used three Roundcube exploits (CVE-2020-35730, CVE-2021-44026, CVE-2020-12641) during another espionage campaign
o	https://cert.gov.ua/article/4905829
The article reports on a recent espionage campaign conducted by the APT28 group, which utilized three exploits targeting Roundcube, a popular email software. The exploits used were CVE-2020-35730, CVE-2021-44026, and CVE-2020-12641. The campaign involved establishing network connections between the Ukrainian government's information and communication system and infrastructure associated with APT28. During the analysis, no evidence of malware infection was found on the computer, however further examination of the user's mailbox revealed an email which contained a malicious article and included an exploit for the Roundcube vulnerability CVE-2020-35730, along with JavaScript code designed to download and execute additional JavaScript files.

(U) Malware:

•	Buhti: New Ransomware Operation Relies on Repurposed Payloads
o	https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/buhti-ransomware
Buhti is a relatively new ransomware operation that utilizes rebranded variants of the leaked LockBit and Babuk ransomware payloads to target Windows and Linux systems. Although Buhti doesn't develop its own ransomware, it uses a custom-developed information stealer tool to search for and archive specific file types. The group initially targeted Linux computers but has also been observed attempting to attack Windows computers. Buhti exploits recently disclosed vulnerabilities, such as the PaperCut vulnerability, to gain unauthorized access. The ransomware payload used by Buhti is a modified version of LockBit 3.0, and the Linux payloads are variants of the leaked Babuk ransomware. While the group relies on repurposed payloads, it appears to have its own custom exfiltration tool for stealing files. Buhti, operating under the name Blacktail, demonstrates competence and adaptability, making it a dangerous adversary despite not developing its own ransomware.

•	Hackers infect Linux SSH servers with Tsunami botnet malware
o	https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-infect-linux-ssh-servers-with-tsunami-botnet-malware/
The article reports on a campaign where unknown threat actors are targeting Linux SSH servers to install various types of malware. The malware includes the Tsunami DDoS bot, ShellBot, log cleaners, privilege escalation tools, and an XMRig coin miner for mining Monero cryptocurrency.

The attackers scan the internet for publicly-exposed Linux SSH servers and then use brute-force attacks to gain unauthorized access by trying numerous username-password combinations. Once they gain access as an admin user, they execute a command to fetch and execute a collection of malware through a Bash script.

The malware downloaded onto compromised servers consists of DDoS botnets, log cleaners, cryptocurrency miners, and privilege escalation tools. Tsunami and ShellBot are the specific DDoS botnet malware used in these attacks. Tsunami, also known as "Ziggy," persists between reboots and supports various remote control commands.

The attackers also employ log cleaners to wipe evidence of intrusion, privilege escalation tools to elevate their privileges, and an XMRig coin miner to exploit the server's resources for mining Monero.

•	Experts Uncover Year-Long Cyber Attack on IT Firm Utilizing Custom Malware RDStealer
o	https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/experts-uncover-year-long-cyber-attack.html
this article discusses A year-long cyber attack on an East Asian IT company, dubbed RedClouds, involved the use of a custom malware called RDStealer. The attackers initially used readily available tools before transitioning to bespoke malware to evade detection. They stored backdoor payloads in Windows folders resembling legitimate applications, and the malware specialized in gathering clipboard content and keystroke data. It also monitored and compromised remote machines through Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections. Another custom malware, Logutil, facilitated persistence on the victim network. The sophisticated attack demonstrates the evolving tactics of cybercriminals and their ability to exploit widely adopted technologies.

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Exploitation: This TTP corresponds to MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1076 - Remote Desktop Protocol, which involves the unauthorized use of RDP to gain access to a system.
Persistence and Command Execution: The use of custom malware (RDStealer and Logutil) to maintain persistence and execute commands aligns with various MITRE ATT&CK techniques, such as T1028 - Windows Remote Management and T1035 - Service Execution.
Credential Compromise: This TTP corresponds to MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1110 - Brute Force, which involves attempting to gain unauthorized access by systematically trying various credentials.

Users are advised to update to the latest version of Aria Operations for Networks to mitigate the risks associated with the vulnerability.

•	nOAuth: How Microsoft OAuth Misconfiguration Can Lead to Full Account Takeover
o	https://www.descope.com/blog/post/noauth

The blog post discusses a security flaw called "nOAuth" that was discovered by the Descope security team in Microsoft Azure AD OAuth applications. The flaw allows for full account takeover in multi-tenant environments. The issue arises from using the mutable and unverified "email" claim as a user identifier, which can be manipulated by an attacker by changing the Email attribute in the Azure AD account.

The blog post highlights that Microsoft had previous documentation advising against using the email address as a unique identifier but has since refactored their documentation and introduced new claims to mitigate the nOAuth issue. These new claims allow apps to verify domain-verified email addresses and redact email claims for unverified domains.

Descope informed vulnerable applications, including a design app, a customer experience company, and a multi-cloud consulting provider, about the issue and helped them address the vulnerability. They also informed authentication providers that were merging user accounts without validation, which could result in full account takeover.

The blog post provides suggested remediation steps for developers to address the nOAuth issue and recommends using the "sub" claim as the unique identifier. It also encourages app developers to regularly review their authentication implementations for security vulnerabilities.

Descope disclosed the nOAuth configuration issue to Microsoft, who issued guidance to customers and worked on deploying fixes. The disclosure timeline and steps taken by Descope and Microsoft are outlined in the blog post.

Overall, the blog post aims to raise awareness about the nOAuth issue and provide guidance for developers to address the vulnerability in their applications.
