			o https://www.scmagazine.com/news/vulnerability-management/mandiant-more-confident-chinese-hackers-were-behind-vmware-hypervisor-malware-campaign
This article provides details on possible threat actor behind VMWare hypervisor malware campaign. Chinese cyber espionage group UNC3886, also known as APT15, has been identified by Mandiant researchers as the likely perpetrator of a hacking campaign targeting VMWare ESXi hosts, vCenter servers, and Windows virtual machines. The researchers have discovered additional links and increased activity by the group, strengthening their attribution. UNC3886 exploited a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-20867) to gain privileged commands on guest virtual machines without authentication. The researchers focus on providing insights into the group's tactics and methodologies to help defenders identify patterns of malicious behavior. The article doesnt detail further specific TTP's of the malware campaign.

	· Hackers can steal cryptographic keys by video-recording power LEDs 60 feet away
			o https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/hackers-can-steal-cryptographic-keys-by-video-recording-connected-power-leds-60-feet-away/

Researchers have demonstrated a new type of side-channel attack that can leak cryptographic keys by video-recording the power LEDs of targeted devices. Unlike traditional side-channel attacks, this method does not require invasive measures or specialized equipment. By utilizing the rolling shutter feature of video cameras, the researchers captured variations in the brightness and color of power LEDs during cryptographic operations. The attack has the advantage of precision and accuracy, overcoming the latency and noise associated with network-based side-channel attacks. However, the attack has limitations and specific prerequisites, such as the target device having a power LED that correlates with power consumption. The attacker needs constant video recording of the power LED while the cryptographic operation takes place. The attack works on certain devices but may not be effective against high-security settings or devices with hardened security measures. The research findings are considered interesting and important, highlighting the power of video-based cryptanalysis and the potential for future advancements in camera technology to enhance the attack. Manufacturers are recommended to implement countermeasures, but it remains uncertain when these measures will be adopted. In the meantime, individuals can take precautions like covering power LEDs to mitigate the vulnerability.

	· Massive phishing campaign uses 6,000 sites to impersonate 100 brands
			o https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/massive-phishing-campaign-uses-6-000-sites-to-impersonate-100-brands/

A massive phishing campaign has been targeting popular apparel, footwear, and clothing brands since June 2022, using fake websites to deceive users into entering their account credentials and financial information. The campaign impersonates over 100 brands, including Nike, Puma, Adidas, and Timberland. Bolster's threat research team discovered the campaign, which relies on thousands of domains and sites, including inactive ones. The campaign experienced a significant increase in activity between January and February 2023, with the addition of 300 new fake sites each month. The scam domains were traced back to specific internet service providers and registered through Alibaba.com Singapore. The phishing sites are designed to closely resemble the official brand websites, featuring realistic content and functional order pages. The exact scam strategy is unclear, but it is suspected that the sites either do not ship the purchased products or provide counterfeit items. Users are advised to exercise caution when searching for official brand websites and to verify URLs through reliable sources such as brand Wikipedia pages or social media channels.

	· VMware ESXi Zero-Day Used by Chinese Espionage Actor to Perform Privileged Guest Operations on Compromised Hypervisors
			o https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/vmware-esxi-zero-day-bypass

In late 2022, Mandiant published details surrounding a novel malware system deployed by UNC3886, a Chinese cyber espionage group, which impacted VMware ESXi hosts, vCenter servers, and Windows virtual machines (VM). Through continued security research and investigations over the past year, Mandiant has discovered additional techniques UNC3886 has utilized across multiple organizations to keep out of the sights of EDR solutions including: 

    Harvesting credentials for service accounts from a vCenter Server for all connected ESXi hosts from the embedded vPostgreSQL server built into vCenter Server Appliance 
    Exploiting a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-20867) that enabled the execution of privileged commands across Windows, Linux, and PhotonOS (vCenter) guest VMs without authentication of guest credentials from a compromised ESXi host and no default logging on guest VMs 
    Deploying backdoors on ESXi hosts using an alternative socket address family, VMCI, for lateral movement and continued persistence. This address family enabled direct reconnection from any guest VM to the compromised ESXi host’s backdoor regardless of network segmentation or firewall rules in place. 
    Continuing to tamper with and disable logging services on impacted systems, presenting additional challenges to investigating UNC3886 in a compromised environment.  
    
        Harvesting credentials for service accounts from a vCenter Server for all connected ESXi hosts from the embedded vPostgreSQL server built into vCenter Server Appliance:
        Technique: Credential Access
            Sub-technique: OS Credential Dumping (T1003)
            Sub-technique: Credentials from Password Stores (T1555)

    Exploiting a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-20867) that enabled the execution of privileged commands across Windows, Linux, and PhotonOS (vCenter) guest VMs without authentication of guest credentials from a compromised ESXi host and no default logging on guest VMs:
        Technique: Exploitation of Vulnerability
            Sub-technique: Exploiting Public-Facing Application (T1190)
            Sub-technique: Exploiting Known Vulnerability (T1210)

    Deploying backdoors on ESXi hosts using an alternative socket address family, VMCI, for lateral movement and continued persistence. This address family enabled direct reconnection from any guest VM to the compromised ESXi host’s backdoor regardless of network segmentation or firewall rules in place:
        Technique: Lateral Movement
            Sub-technique: Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares (T1021.001)
            Sub-technique: Remote Services: Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion (T1021.003)

    Continuing to tamper with and disable logging services on impacted systems, presenting additional challenges to investigating UNC3886 in a compromised environment:
        Technique: Defense Evasion
            Sub-technique: Disabling Security Tools (T1562.001)
            Sub-technique: Indicator Removal on Host (T1070.004)
